## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: Which authentication approach should the React application use? ‚Üí A: OAuth 2.0 flow (redirect to Databricks login, get temporary token)
- Q: When users refresh their browser or navigate away mid-configuration, how should their wizard progress be handled? ‚Üí A: Browser localStorage (persists across sessions on same device/browser)
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable response time for the UI to calculate and update estimated metrics when users adjust sliders? ‚Üí A: 100ms (instant, requires client-side calculation only)
- Q: How should the React frontend communicate with the Python backend for job submission? ‚Üí A: Through Databricks Jobs API only (no custom backend)
- Q: How frequently should the UI poll the Databricks Jobs API to update job status during generation? ‚Üí A: Every 5 seconds (balanced, standard for job monitoring)

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A data analyst needs to generate synthetic identity graph datasets for testing their analytics pipelines. They access a modern web interface where they configure dataset parameters through a step-by-step wizard, review their configuration, and submit a generation job. The interface provides visual feedback on their choices and guides them to create valid configurations.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the user opens the application in their browser, **When** they view the landing page, **Then** they see a clear title, description, and a visual progress indicator showing 5 configuration steps

2. **Given** the user is on the Household configuration step, **When** they adjust the number of households slider, **Then** they see an instant calculation of the estimated number of individuals

3. **Given** the user is configuring income distribution, **When** they move one income bracket slider, **Then** the other brackets automatically adjust proportionally to maintain a sum of 1.0

4. **Given** the user has completed all configuration steps, **When** they reach the Review step, **Then** they see a comprehensive summary of all their choices organized by category

5. **Given** the user submits a generation job, **When** the job is queued, **Then** they see real-time progress updates with estimated completion time

6. **Given** the user navigates between wizard steps, **When** they click Previous/Next buttons, **Then** their configuration values persist and the progress indicator updates accordingly

7. **Given** the user has an invalid configuration, **When** they try to proceed to the next step, **Then** they see clear error messages explaining what needs to be corrected

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user refreshes the browser mid-configuration?
  - The system must restore configuration from browser localStorage and return to the same wizard step

- What happens when the user loses network connectivity during job submission?
  - The system must show a clear error message and allow retry without losing configuration

- What happens when multiple users submit large generation jobs simultaneously?
  - The system must queue jobs and provide accurate wait time estimates

- How does the system handle invalid slider values entered manually?
  - The system must validate input and display clear error messages with acceptable ranges

- What happens when a generation job fails?
  - The system must display the error details and allow the user to modify configuration and resubmit
