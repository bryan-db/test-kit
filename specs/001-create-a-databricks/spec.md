## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: Where should generated datasets be persisted? → A: Unity Catalog tables in `bryan_li` catalog (Delta Lake format)
- Q: What is the target dataset scale? → A: Configurable across all ranges (1K to 1M+ households)
- Q: What is the acceptable generation time for large-scale datasets? → A: Real-time (< 5 minutes for any size)
- Q: How should users interact with the app to configure data generation? → A: Multi-step wizard guiding through entity types sequentially
- Q: What authentication and authorization model should the app use? → A: Workspace permissions + catalog-level access controls for `bryan_li` catalog

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a data scientist or marketing analyst, I need to generate realistic synthetic datasets representing consumer identity graphs so that I can test and validate analytics models, audience segmentation algorithms, and campaign optimization strategies without using real customer data, ensuring privacy compliance while maintaining realistic data patterns and relationships.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is launched, **When** I progress through the multi-step wizard specifying dataset size and characteristics for each entity type, **Then** the system generates a complete identity graph with households, individuals, and all required relationship mappings
2. **Given** the identity graph is generated, **When** I request demographic data, **Then** the system produces realistic demographic profiles for each individual including age, gender, income bracket, and geographic location
3. **Given** individuals exist in the dataset, **When** I generate engagement data, **Then** the system creates realistic content viewership patterns with temporal distribution and preference clustering
4. **Given** engagement data exists, **When** I derive audience attributes, **Then** the system automatically calculates audience segments, affinity scores, and behavioral classifications based on the engagement patterns
5. **Given** audience attributes are defined, **When** I generate campaign data, **Then** the system creates campaign exposure records with realistic reach and frequency distributions
6. **Given** campaign exposures exist, **When** I generate response data, **Then** the system produces outcome metrics including conversions, engagement responses, and attribution data that correlate with campaign exposures and audience attributes

### Edge Cases
- What happens when household size parameters result in orphaned individuals?
- How does the system handle temporal consistency across engagement events and campaign exposures?
- What happens when requesting demographically impossible combinations (e.g., age/income mismatches)?
- How does the system ensure referential integrity across the identity graph when generating related datasets?
- What happens when campaign exposure overlaps with multiple household members?
- What happens when a user lacks CREATE TABLE privileges in the `bryan_li` catalog?
- How does the system handle concurrent generation requests from multiple users?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate synthetic household entities with parameters for household size distribution (average, min, max)
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate synthetic individual entities linked to households with unique identifiers
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate realistic demographic attributes for individuals including age, gender, income bracket, education level, and geographic location
- **FR-004**: System MUST generate content engagement events with timestamps, content identifiers, duration, and engagement type (view, click, share)
- **FR-005**: System MUST generate viewership data showing temporal patterns and frequency distributions parameters for (days, weeks, months, years)
- **FR-006**: System MUST derive audience attributes from engagement patterns including segment assignments, affinity scores, and behavioral classifications
- **FR-007**: System MUST generate campaign exposure records linking individuals to marketing campaigns with timestamp and channel information
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate response and outcome data including conversion events, engagement metrics, and attribution signals
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain referential integrity across all entities ensuring all foreign keys resolve correctly
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide a multi-step wizard interface allowing users to configure dataset parameters sequentially: household configuration, individual demographics, engagement patterns, audience attributes, campaigns, and response metrics
- **FR-010a**: Each wizard step MUST validate inputs before allowing progression to the next step
- **FR-011**: System MUST produce deterministic outputs when given the same seed value for reproducibility
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate that generated data adheres to realistic statistical distributions such as normal, power law, seasonal patterns.
- **FR-013**: System MUST export generated datasets saved to Unity Catalog tables
- **FR-014**: System MUST generate data that maintains temporal consistency (e.g., campaign responses must occur after exposures)
- **FR-015**: System MUST support incremental data generation to append new records to existing datasets 
- **FR-016**: Users MUST be able to specify demographic distribution parameters to match target market characteristics
- **FR-017**: System MUST generate cross-device identity mappings showing multiple identifiers per individual including these identifiers - cookies, mobile IDs, email hashes, device IDs
